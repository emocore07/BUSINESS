(If you're using the free version of Texture Packer, set Algorithm to Basic, set Trim mode to None, set Extrude to 0, set Size constraints to Any size and slide the PNG Opt Level all the way to the left to 0. These are the basic settings that will allow the free version of Texture Packer to create your files without any warnings or errors.)
